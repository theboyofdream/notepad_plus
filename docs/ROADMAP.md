# Roadmap

I don't have any roadmap. I build this for myself. But if you find it useful & want to contribute, this are things which are pending.

For myself only:

- [ ] create landing page for the app download
- [ ] create dashboard for features request & bug report & reviews

Everyone can contribute:

- [ ] change font size
- [ ] upload custom font family
- [ ] sometime few keybindings don't work
- [ ] save multiple files in single click
- [ ] close multiple files in single click
- [ ] context menu for tabs
- [ ] add keybinding for zoom in/out
- [ ] customize shortcuts
- [ ] handle large file efficiently
- [ ] show recent files in taskbar & in app menu
- [ ] context menu for editor with options like (copy, paste, cut, select all, find, replace, save, save as, undo, redo, print)
- [ ] compile for mac & linux distros.
